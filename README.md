### Hiya! I'm Kaia. 👋
  
I yell about design all day and make sure containers and packages you're shippin' don't break.
  
Current projects include...  
📃 — resume for packaging things, written in LaTeX  
✨ — frontend for assorted web projects  
➰ — generative design using Grasshopper (Rhino) and from scratch in C++, CUDA, and JavaScript  
📦 — testing of different corrugated medium shapes via Grasshopper and Kangaroo (Rhino) and lab equipment  
📦 — animated package nets via JavaScript (It's pointless motion design!)  
📐 — Solidworks plugins for fixing floating point precision across multiple tools
