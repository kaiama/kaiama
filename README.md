### Hiya! I'm Kaia. 👋
  
I yell about design all day and make sure containers and packages you're shippin' don't break.
  
Current projects include...  
📃 — resume for packaging things, written in LaTeX  
✨ — frontend for assorted web projects  
➰ — generative design using Grasshopper (Rhino) with scripts to run other functions  
📦 — breaking software in an endless quest to make better packages  
📐 — Solidworks plugins... There's too many. Please help.
