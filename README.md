### Hiya! I'm Kaia. 👋
  
I yell about design all day and make sure stuff you're shippin' doesn't break.
  
Current projects include...  
✨ — front-end for assorted web projects  
📦 — animated package nets via JavaScript (It's pointless motion design!)  
📐 — Solidworks plugins for fixing floating points and creating generative structures
